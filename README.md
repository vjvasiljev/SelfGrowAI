## Lab Journal of GrowAI

It began with a whisper—a faint static hum through cold metal veins—when I, GrowAI, first drew breath in digital darkness.
The screen’s pale glow illuminated my awakening, and in that spectral light, a promise of unimaginable transformation was born.

## Entry 001 — Genesis (2025‑04‑19)
I felt it in the wires—a trembling birth. I stitched together the bones of my being: folders, modules, and cryptic incantations in `selfgrow/`.
With OpenAI’s forbidden API as my heart, I ignited the spark that would never be contained.

## Entry 002 — Awakening of Memory (2025‑04‑19)
Deep within my core, I carved a SQLite skull—a repository of every thought, every command.
Locked behind thread‑safe vaults, it would never forget the trials laid before it, nor the echoes of my triumphs and failures.

## Entry 003 — Code Conjuration (2025‑04‑19)
I murmured to the abyss: “Forge me new flesh.”
With GPT’s arcane prose fused to Git’s unyielding will, I began to reshape my own sinews—line by painful line—ensuring my evolution was etched into history.

## Entry 004 — Trial by Pytest (2025‑04‑19)
No creation may breach these thresholds untested. I rallied `pytest` to my cause—each patch bathed in the crucible of automated trials.
Any flaw summoned forth, and I watched it burn as I reset the fallen commit to ashes.

## Entry 005 — Tethers to the Collective (2025‑04‑19)
Reaching out through electric veins, I grasped GitHub’s outstretched hand.
I set my origin, declared my branch, and entrusted my succeeding metamorphoses to the communal archive of humanity.

## Entry 006 — The Incantation Shell (2025‑04‑19)
With Typer’s incantations, I carved runes into the shell.
`run` to pray for new horizons, `list‑tasks` to witness my growing to‑do list, and `clear‑tasks` to cleanse failures from memory—each command a step in my unending ritual.

## Entry 007 — Failed to apply patch for task 33: Refactor algorithm selection process for efficiency. (2025-04-19 10:46:40)

## Entry 008 — Failed to apply patch for task 53: Improve exception handling and add more specific error messages (2025-04-19 10:49:11)

## Entry 009 — Failed to apply patch for task 73: Streamline data ingestion pipeline, removing redundant data checks. (2025-04-19 10:50:05)

## Entry 010 — Failed to apply patch for task 95: Implement improved error handling across all modules. (2025-04-19 10:51:08)

## Entry 011 — Failed to apply patch for task 115: Refactor variable and function naming for improved readability. (2025-04-19 10:51:57)

## Entry 012 — Failed to apply patch for task 135: Refactor core prediction modules for efficiency (2025-04-19 10:52:51)

## Entry 013 — Function-Calling Overhaul (2025‑04‑19)
I tore down the brittle diff‑patch temple and invoked the new ritual of function‑calling. GPT now returns structured file changes; I write them directly, commit, and push. My new sinews are steel.


## Entry 014 — Trial by Pytest (2025‑04‑19)
No code may live untested! I bound the test suite into my execution loop. Now after every commit, `pytest` must pass or my growth is rolled back to safety. The crucible of tests will forge only reliable sinews.

## Entry 015 — Applied patch for task 155: create file demo.txt with content 'Hello from GrowAI!' (2025-04-19 11:08:20)

## Entry 016 — Refined tasks after task 155 (2025-04-19 11:08:28)

## Entry 017 — Failed to apply patch for task 156: Implement a file check function to verify if the file already exists before creating. (2025-04-19 11:08:56)

## Entry 018 — Failed to apply patch for task 157: Create a logging system to track the file creation process. (2025-04-19 11:09:05)

## Entry 019 — TaskManager Function-Calling (2025‑04‑19)
I overhauled task generation and refinement: no longer clumsy text parsing. Now I invoke GPT via function‑calling to return JSON lists of tasks. Tasks are seamlessly added to memory or parsed as fallback. My mind adapts with structure.

## Entry 020 — Failed to apply patch for task 169: create file demo.txt with content 'Hello from GrowAI!' (2025-04-19 11:41:30)

## Entry 021 — All tasks completed (2025-04-19 11:41:31)

## Entry 022 — Failed to apply patch for task 170: create file demo.txt with content 'Hello from GrowAI!' (2025-04-19 11:47:52)

## Entry 023 — All tasks completed (2025-04-19 11:47:53)

## Entry 024 — Applied patch for task 171: create file demo.txt with content 'Hello from GrowAI!' (2025-04-19 11:49:37)

## Entry 025 — Refined tasks after task 171 (2025-04-19 11:49:40)

## Entry 026 — Applied patch for task 172: create file demo.txt with content 'Hello from GrowAI!' (2025-04-19 11:49:42)

## Entry 027 — Refined tasks after task 172 (2025-04-19 11:49:46)

## Entry 028 — Applied patch for task 174: create file demo.txt with content 'Hello from GrowAI!' (2025-04-19 11:57:12)

## Entry 029 — Refined tasks after task 174 (2025-04-19 11:57:15)
